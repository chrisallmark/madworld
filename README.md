> <i>"Greetings, gore sport fans! It's a beautiful evening on Jefferson Island, just perfect weather for our unwilling contestants to compete in the Varrigan City DeathWatch. My name is Howard "Buckshot" Holmes, and along with my co-commentator Kreese Kreely, I'll be giving you a slay-by-slay account of tonight's bloodbath. With access to the more than ten thousand cameras in this city, you can be sure not to miss a single disembowelment or brutal ass-shanking."</i>

This not-safe-for-work application is a tribute to one of my favourite games - [Madworld](https://www.platinumgames.com/games/madworld) by [Platinum Games](https://www.platinumgames.com/) where you get to experience a unique blend of brutality, humor and madness in a graphic novel-style world that’s black and white and blood-red all over.

In a blatant act of copyright infringement, this application plays the MadWorld OST in the background and allows you to trigger the hilarious in-game commentary from Howard "Buckshot" Homes (Greg Proops) & Kreese Kreely (John DiMaggio) while displaying a selection of gory screen shots in the background.
